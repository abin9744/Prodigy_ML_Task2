# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This repository contains Python code to perform customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The dataset used for this analysis is from Kaggle's Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) contains information about customers including their annual income and spending score.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Description
Python script that performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering. It includes preprocessing of data, determination of optimal number of clusters using Silhouette Score, and visualization of clusters.

## Results
- The script generates visualizations of clusters based on annual income and spending score.
- It also provides a Silhouette Score vs. Number of Clusters plot to help determine the optimal number of clusters.
